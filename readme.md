# wp-login.php Rick Roll!

Say you have a static site. Sometimes people will still check to see if you're running Wordpress.

You can see if this is happening by checking your logs for 404 errors to /wp-login.php

This script will send anyone trying to login to your Wordpress install to the infamour Rick Roll youtube page (although you could change it to anything you want).

You could also do some stuff like saving the credentials into a database...

## Requirements

- PHP
- A sense of humour
